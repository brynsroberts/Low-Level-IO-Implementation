# MASM Low Level I/O Procedure Implementation

## Authors

* **Bryan Roberts**

## Description: 

The program implements low level string to decimal and decimal to string conversion.  It implements a test program which will collect 10 decimal values from the user which need to fit within a signed 32-bit range.  User input is validated and then converted from the string input to a decimal value and stored in an array.  After collecting 10 values from the user, the values will be displayed back to the user, converting the decimal values to strings.  Then the sum and average will be calculated based on the decimal values, and will be converted to strings to display to the console.
